glee is a bulk delete tool that I created. It's very simple to use. To get started, go to line 236 in the code and insert your token. Then, run the file using the command line or any Python-compatible environment.

Be sure to open the setup file afterward to download all the required libraries.

If you need assistance, feel free to create an "issue" or a similar request on GitHub.

Note that the process may take some time, depending on how long it has been since you last sent a message and how active the chat or DM is. This is because it needs to fetch your messages from the chat.

You need the channel open while deleting messages (dms), and because of rate limits it takes a lil bit to delete (reason i tried my best to add an anti rate limit)
