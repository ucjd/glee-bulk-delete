Glee is a bulk delete tool I created. It's very simple to use. To get started, go to line 236 in the code and insert your token. Then, run the file using the command line or any Python-compatible environment.

Make sure to open the setup file afterwards to download all the required libraries.

If you need help, feel free to create an "issue" or similar on GitHub.
